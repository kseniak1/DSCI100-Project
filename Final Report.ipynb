    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, analysis on data from the High Time Resolution Universe Pulsar Survey (Keith et al., 2010) will be done to gain a better understanding of how to better classify Neutron stars (also known as pulsars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying pulsars allows researchers to explore “space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter.” However, radio signals received to identify pulsars are obstructed with radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise. As a result, there is demand for advanced learning tools that will be able to automatically label pulsar candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pulse’s signal is integrated with respect to its rotational period, a unique integrated profile can be created for the pulse. A DM-SNR curve plots the spectral supernova remnants (SNR) as a function of the trail dispersion measure (DM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The question that this project will answer is “Which variable, between integrated profile and DM-SNR, is a better predictor for class?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that is used for this project provides information on 17,898 candidates—16,259 are examples of RFI/noise, and 1,639 are examples of real pulsars. 8 variables corresponding to data about the integrated profile and DM-SNR curve of the candidates, will be further analyzed in the project to answer the research question.\n"
